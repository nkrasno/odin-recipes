# odin-recipes

Welcome to my second attempt! I'm building a website that'll contain links to some recipes using basic HTML. The goal is to practice HTML and Git, by completing the ["Project: Recipes"](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) lesson in The Odin Project (or TOP).

The first try was ok (it can improve! But hey, I'm just starting), but I know I made some mistakes when passing commits in the terminal and I wish to practice that part I bit more.

This assignment will also help me improve my english, so please show me if I made a typo.

## update

I've started the CSS foundation lessons in TOP and added some style to the website, mostly I just played with the basics to test my understanding on the matter. See how it's looking [here](https://nkrasno.github.io/odin-recipes/).
